I used parcel to easily compile and test all of my scripts. I came across this package because of a friend who directed me towards it. I wrote all of the processing of the JSON file in javascript. 

The HTML was used to format the table and the css I made was used to make a simple table that makes the inforamtion a little more presentable.

P.S - I really like the MF DOOM reference :)
