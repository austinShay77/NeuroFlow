# NeuroFlow Challenge

In order to use this program, all you need to do is download the files given and run the commands 'npm install' then 'npm run dev'. Please make sure to be in the correct project folder when doing so.

I used parcel to compile the program so I could see the output of it. I came across this program because of a friend who directed me towards it. I wrote all of the processing of the json file in javascript. 

The HTML was used to format the table and the css I made was used to make a simple table that makes the inforamtion a little easier to read.

P.S - I really like the MF DOOM reference
